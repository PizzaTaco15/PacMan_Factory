# PacMan_Factory
When you start PacMan Factory there will be two buttons, Add PacMan and Start Game. When you press Add PacMan a PacMan will appear in a random position on your screen and will set a random speed and direction to that PacMan. When you press Start Game PacMan will begin to move in the direction and at the speed that was set until he hits a wall wear he will bounce off it.
